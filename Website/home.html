            <p>
                Robotics is a branch of science that incorporates computer science and engineering to construct and
                design automated mechanical systems. These systems are used to assist humans and perform tasks such as
                exploration, manufacturing, medical, military and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Robotics is not only one of the most important branches of science, but it is also extremely fascinating and interesting.
                To the household robotic vacuum cleaner that makes life easier to the factory robotic manufacturing arm constructing cars
                to the distant Mars planet roamed by NASA rovers. Robotics is almost everywhere while being the most interesting field to work in, combining computer science and engineering.
